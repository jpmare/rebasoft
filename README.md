# Rebasoft ToDo List Demo

### Pre Requisites
To run this react application you will either need to install yarn or npm. This depends on your operating software. 
For example on a mac to install yarn simply run the following command in your terminal: 
`brew install yarn`

### Starting application
To start the application and depending on your choice between yarn or npm run either of the following commands in the root of the application:
`npm start`
or
`yarn start`

### Compatibility
this application has been tested in the latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers as well as on a selection for mobile devices.

### Notice
This application uses an API to retrieve data but that is not 
persisted when changes are made. Thus any changes to the initially loaded todo 
list, i.e. deleting, updating or adding new items will only be persisted for the duration of the browser session, 
refreshing the page or app will result in the data resetting back to the initial list, disregarding all changes made.
